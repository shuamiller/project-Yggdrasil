*UNFINISHED*

This is an expansive, web-based text adventure game. The current focus is building the UI, and implementing basic JS objects and functionality.
The World of pYgg will be stored in JS mostly through Objects. I'm currently learning DOM manipulation, so my first goal is learning how to grab text
from JS Objects and push it to the UI. Once I figure that out I will work on creating those reactions based on user input by making action words available
for the user to well... use. At first these actions will be simple: Take, Go, and Talk will probably be the first I implement. And from there it will be mostly
world-building.

Down the road, I would like to implement more options for the user such as combat, detailed/layered NPC interaction, and hard-to-reach areas or game-states.
But the main purpose of this game is exploration and discovering new worlds with rich, yet elusive lore. And eventually once I have the functionality, writing style,
and formatting solidified, I would like to open this project up for contribution, allowing other devs and storytellers to create their own Worlds within pYgg.
